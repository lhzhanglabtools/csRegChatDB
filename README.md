## Tutorial for Build context-specific RegChatDB

## The following is a step-by-step tutorial on building a database, covering the execution logic and key operations of four core scripts

Step1: Detecting the interaction between peak regions (step1_detect_TFs_for_peaks.R)
Step2: Fine grained detection based on ArchR (step2_detect_ITs_for_peaks_upon_ArchR.R)
Step3: Generate TF-TG relationship pairs (step3_generate_tf_tg.py)
Step4: Build the final database (step4_build_database.py)

### The example can be found in the [tutorial]([https://github.com/lhzhanglabtools/RegChat/blob/main/tutorials/run_RegChat_on_simulation_data.ipynb](https://github.com/lhzhanglabtools/csRegChatDB/blob/main/Tutorial/tutorial_for_build_db.md)
